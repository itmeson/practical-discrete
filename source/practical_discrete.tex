%%  syntax package will display SAGE code inline (code not executed)
%%  Needs \% to effect a percent symbol
%%  sagetex package offers a \percent, which we might use if supported by tex4ht
%%  Needs \caret command (defined below) to effect SAGE exponentiation output
%%  It would be nice to accomplish all this with the sagetex package - just 
%%  inline pretty-printing of very small hunks of SAGE, with no evaluation
